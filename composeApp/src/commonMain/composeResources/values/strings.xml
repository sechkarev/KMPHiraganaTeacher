    <string name="challenge1_welcome_message">Welcome!</string>
    <string name="challenge1_text">The Japanese language is special, because it uses three different writing systems: hiragana and katakana, two syllabaries (syllable alphabets) invented in the 9th century, and the Chinese characters (kanji) which were imported even earlier.\nThis app is intended to teach you hiragana: the system most learners start with, because it has the most widespread use.\nLet’s get into it! We’ll start with the vocals. This is I, pronounced like ‘e’ in ‘me’. Click on the animation to hear how it sounds like!</string>
    <string name="challenge1_task">Now try to draw it yourself! Use exactly two strokes: draw first the left part, then the right.</string>
    <string name="challenge2_task">Good, we’re off to a good start! (You can tap on your solution every time to hear how it is supposed to be pronounced.) Now do it again in the same manner, so you do not forget it in a minute.</string>
    <string name="challenge3_text">Great! Let’s continue. This is E. Sounds like the first ‘e’ in ‘every’.</string>
    <string name="challenge3_task">Draw it! Start from the top. Again, two strokes only.</string>
    <string name="challenge4_task">As they say, repetition is the mother of learning. One more E, please.</string>
    <string name="challenge5_task">And another one! But this time, there is no hint!</string>
    <string name="challenge6_task">Nice! Back to I now. I hope you have not forgotten how it looks like yet…</string>
    <string name="challenge7_task">Awesome! Now draw these two vocals back to back, I first, E second. You have four strokes.</string>
    <string name="challenge8_congratulations">Congratulations! You’ve learned a word 🎉</string>
    <string name="challenge8_task">Yes, you have seen exactly zero consonants yet, but in Japanese, words comprising only vocals are much more common than in English.\nThere’s another one actually! Draw IIE. You have 6 strokes.</string>
    <string name="challenge9_congratulations">Surprise-surprise! IIE is also a word 🎉</string>
    <string name="challenge9_task">A new task. Are you afraid to continue? Answer in Japanese.</string>
    <string name="challenge10_text">It’s good that you’re fearless, because the next challenge is timed. You need to know how to draw characters fast!\nThe timer isn’t running yet: it will turn on once you start drawing. You'll have 10 seconds.\nThe question is: are you afraid this time? Answer in Japanese.</string>
    <string name="challenge11_text">You made it! Now... what if instead of ten seconds you had just five? It’s less than a second per stroke!\nThis is probably the toughest challenge you’ve encountered so far. Will you fail it? Answer in Japanese.</string>
    <string name="challenge12_text">People usually learn vocals first, but since you know how to say no now, let’s make a quick detour to learn its counterpart. The Japanese for yes is HAI.\nThis word comprises two characters: one for HA and I, which you already know. There is no character just for H in Japanese: every consonant must be superseded by a vocal. There is one exception though... which we’ll get to in due time.\nFirst things first, let’s learn how to draw HA.</string>
    <string name="challenge12_task">Now draw it yourself. Use three strokes.</string>
    <string name="challenge13_task">And once again, without a hint. For good measure.</string>
    <string name="challenge14_task">Okay, you are ready now. Do you wish to continue? Answer in Japanese and use exactly five strokes.</string>
    <string name="challenge_text_recognition_mistake">Uh-oh! The computer recognises your drawing as %1$s. Try again!</string>
