# ㊗️ Hiragana Teacher

Hiragana Teacher is an Android & iOS app aiming to teach its users the basics of Japanese ⛩️.

When I started learning Japanese in 2024, none of the apps available in the Play Store really impressed me: as well as many books on the subject, they mostly resorted to boring and repetitive drills. I, on the other hand, wanted every step of the learning process to be memorable, so I decided to create my own app – an experience that would feel playful and inspirational. 

## ✨ Features and screenshots
- Hiragana Teacher is broken down plenty of little tasks, and each of them is solved by drawing a character or even an entire word.
- Every solved task yields you new knowledge – as you go, you learn new words as well as interesting facts about Japan.
- You get recommended some further reading as you learn, so you never feel stuck.
- You earn achievements as you solve tasks.
